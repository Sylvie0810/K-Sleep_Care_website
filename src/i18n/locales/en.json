      "p1": "Sleep is not a luxury—it's a fundamental pillar of health. Quality sleep affects every aspect of our lives, from physical health and mental clarity to emotional well-being and daily performance.",
      "p2": "In America, sleep deprivation has reached epidemic proportions. Millions of adults struggle with sleep disorders, yet many remain undiagnosed and untreated. The consequences extend far beyond feeling tired—untreated sleep disorders can lead to serious health complications, reduced quality of life, and even premature death."

      "title": "What is Sleep Apnea?",
      "p1": "Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The most common type, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), occurs when throat muscles intermittently relax and block your airway. This leads to fragmented sleep, reduced oxygen levels, and numerous health consequences if left untreated.",
      "p2": "Each time your breathing stops, your brain briefly wakes you up to restart breathing—often so briefly you don't remember it. This cycle can repeat hundreds of times per night, preventing you from reaching the deep, restorative stages of sleep your body needs."
